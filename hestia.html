      <h2>Hestia (Page WIP)</h2>
      <p>Alright, so out of everything, this probably will take the most explaining. On my own personal computer and server, I have a file/project management system I call Peridot. She's a cobbled together, screwed up, messy little beauty and I'm happy with her. <br><br>
	However, she works with <i>files</i> and I work more often with <i>math.</i> So whenever I was designing LaTeX packages and math-related customizations, I picked a new name: Hestia! <br><br>
	I use Hestia as a name for a bunch of things, mostly my Emacs customizations, visual customizations, and math files. I'll try to give a decent breakdown here. <br><br>
	I use Hestia to personify a lot of aspects about how I interact with my computer. Imagine that I think of Hestia as a typesetting artist who loves things looking nice and neat, and you'll be pretty close.

    <div>
      <h2>hestia-latex</h2>
      <p> The <code>hestia-latex</code> project is the biggest--and most public--of my Hestia projects. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/hailey-jay/hestia-latex"> here<a>. It's divided into several parts:
	<ul>
	  <li><code>hestia</code></li>
	  <li><code>hestia-journal</code></li>
	  <li><code>hestia-symb</code></li>
	  <li><code>hestia-cd</code></li>
	  <li><code>hestia-mono</code></li>
	  <li><code>hestia-extra</code></li>
	</ul>
	The first two are classes. To be honest, I'm unsatisfied with them as of current and I plan to build them up from scratch, but for now, they're a little basic.
	<br><br>
	First, <code>hestia</code>. It's just an article copy with a different title and page setup that's a little bit nicer for turning in homework. I'd never write a paper using it, though, I'd do that with a different template. I think my professor has a decent layout, even though I have massive philosophical differences with the way he codes.<br><br>
	The other class file is <code>hestia-journal</code>. It's pulled from my old notes whenever I was self-studying for Advanced Calculus II and wanted to mimic my professor's style. Speaking of, I should probably put those up, minus the homework solutions, on my notes page. Can't hurt. I'll even put the source just in the case any undergrads want to make improvements on my poor notetaking skills!<br>
	One might notice that the output of <code>hestia-journal</code> is similar to my notes currently. This is not quite true. While my current notes are based on <code>hestia-journal</code>, their customizations are entirely in the source because the project is a lot bigger than one style file. I do plan on folding them together, but that's a much bigger and much harder project.<br><br>
	Now, the packages. The most important is <code>hestia-symb</code>. It's a collection of shorthands, command definitions, and other small customizations that I've collected over the years. My favorite feature? Proofs have my custom rose as their halmos instead of the box. It's a cute, personal touch and I insist upon it for my notes and homework.<br><br>
	    Next, <code>hestia-cd</code>. It's a work in progress because I just learned Lua (as of early 2025) but it's incredibly helpful. It's a shorthand layer on top of <code>tikz-cd</code>, so it doesn't do anything crazy novel, but it is a rather elegant system in my opinion. I'll take the time to explain what it's doing!

      <p align="center"><img src="hestia/cdin.png" alt="LaTeX source." align="center" style="width:400px"><img src="hestia/cdout.png" alt="A commutative diagram." align="center" style="width:400px"><br><br><small><i><code>hestia-cd</code> in action.</i></small><p>

	The first line, neither A nor B have a defined location. So A is placed and B's location is determined by the arrow direction. The next two lines are the same; the fourth simply doesn't require a direction as both are already placed. The 5th line includes naming the arrow using <code>by ~phi</code>, replacing backslashes with tilde for compatibility issues. It also writes a dotted arrow, recognizing that <code>..\></code> and <code>--\></code> ought to mean different things. The last two things of note are showing off how brackets group words together fairly harmlessly, and <code>data</code> to reassign the content of object D.
	<br><br>
	The only two left, <code>hestia-extra</code> and <code>hestia-mono<code>, do what the say on the tin. The first, I doubt that it'll stay for a while. To be honest, I want to remove it at some point! The other stays. It's cool. Makes everything look like a typewriter.

      <h2>Everything Else</h2>
      <p>Why have two sections? LaTeX and everything else? Well, it's because I'm a little shy. The only things I really want to share on the internet is my LaTeX because, even if it's not quite the best, it's at least decent!<br><br>
	However, the "everything else" here is a little less... good. It's really useful for me and I use it every day! But it's also <i>only</i> really useful for me and I doubt anyone would ever get decent usage out of it. <br><br>
	Enough of my self-pitying rant. Let's go.
      </p></div><div>
      <h3>Emacs</h3>
      <p> Of course I use Emacs. Like, I'm a transgirl who has a ThinkPad running Archlinux. It's almost an inevitability that I'd use Emacs.<br><br>
	For Emacs, I use Hestia's name for two things: The display and the math. I'll talk briefly about the math, because the display is something I'd rather talk about in the... "Display" section.<br><br>
	Loading Emacs loads 'hestia.el'. It's not quite an AucTeX replacement, more of an augmentation, but it alleviates a bunch of my biggest annoyances with it.<br><br>
	Firstly: I come from TeXStudio. It was my first LaTeX editor and I loved it. Unfortunately, I outgrew it! I wanted something more customizable and I switched to Kate and eventually Emacs. A couple of the keybinds and functionalities from that, I took with me and now I find it much faster to delimit math both in $inline mode$ and \[display mode\].<br><br>
	I also bound a lot of 'C-c' keys to environments. 'C-c n' gives 'enumerate', 'C-c p' gives proof, 'C-c e' gives a generic environment substitute for AucTeX's 'C-c C-e', etc.<br><br>
	The last really cool customization is the shell command popouts. 'C-x C-r' runs my compiler with my custom settings, set in the options (I use LuaLaTex mostly) and refreshes the log file if it's open. I need it open more often than you'd think. I mess up a lot!<br><br>
	There's a bunch of other little things--'x-space' ensures that I don't accidentally put math too close to text--but I think that's the gist.

      <h3>Themes</h3>
      <p>
	Unsurprisingly, I have some particularities when it comes to theming my applications and computers! All of these fall under the umbrella of Hestia.<br><br>
	I have a few things I'd like to show! First, Mayday. Mayday is my laptop and newest addition to my family.<br>
	
	  <p align="center"><img src="hestia/mayday.png" alt="Mayday desktop, showing background with a tree and a rose symbol." align="center" style="width:80%"><br><br><small><i>Mayday!</i></small><p>
	
	Mayday's background was done by the incredibly talented <a href="https://dictatordoggocommisions.carrd.co/">Dictator Doggo</a>, and features a tree with plort-like fruit and the names of most of my computers using a script for a conlang I did once. "Mayday" is the name in the upper right!
	<br><br>
	There's also some basic application things that'd be fun to show! I've selected Emacs and Konsole for this purpose.
	<br>
	<p align="center"><img src="hestia/emacs.png" alt="Emacs window in pink and dark blue-grey." align="center" style="width:50%"><img src="hestia/konsole.png" alt="Konsole window with splash message across the top." align="center" style="width:50%"><br><br><small><i>Emacs and Konsole customizations!</i></small><p>

	The only comment to make here is that the Konsole window features a splash message across the top. It's from the same splash message list that the homepage of this site pulls from (given that I've done it correctly, not a guarantee)! It has a bunch of things my friends have said and it's a way for me to remember them every time I open a new window. I love my friends and having them so close is pretty enjoyable.
